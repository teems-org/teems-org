    "text": "1 Introduction\nReproducibility within computable general equilibrium (CGE) and partial equilibrium modelling analyses has long been elusive. Here we present TEEMS (Trade and Environmental Equilibrium Modeling System), a set of tools which includes the R package teems used to compose model runs and teems-solver, a C-based solver capable of solving a large system of nonlinear equations by leveraging a range of mathematical and scientific computation libraries. Auxillary repositories include teems-scripts which showcases a wide variety of model configurations and options, teems-tabs and teems-closures which houses models and their respective standard closures that are immediately available to users, and teems-mappings with a range of set mappings for various model components. Together these components allow for an open and modular pipeline software platform which handles all aspects of an equilibrium model run from head to tail.",

    "text": "1.1 Motivation\nThis is in large part due to the proprietary nature of associated software and data but also due to the shear complexity of compiling a single model run.\nData analysis can be slow. A round of scientific computation can take several minutes, hours, or even days to complete. After it finishes, if you update your code or data, your hard-earned results may no longer be valid. Unchecked, this invalidation creates chronic Sisyphean loop:\n\nLaunch the code.\nWait while it runs.\nDiscover an issue.\nRestart from scratch.",

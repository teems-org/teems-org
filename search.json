    "text": "1 Introduction\nReproducibility within computable general equilibrium (CGE) and partial equilibrium modelling analyses has long been elusive. Here we present TEEMS (Trade and Environmental Equilibrium Modeling System), a set of tools which includes the R package teems used to compose model runs and teems-solver, a C-based solver capable of solving a large system of nonlinear equations by leveraging a range of mathematical and scientific computation libraries. Auxillary repositories include teems-scripts which showcases a wide variety of model configurations and options, teems-tabs and teems-closures which houses models and their respective standard closures that are immediately available to users, and teems-mappings with a range of set mappings for various model components.\nTogether these components allow for an open and modular pipeline software platform which handles all aspects of an equilibrium model run from head to tail through reproducible workflows that allows the user to seamlessly adjust model components including set aggregations, parameter weighting, closure and shock specifications as well as a large number of options pertaining to the solution and model outputs.",

    "text": "1.1 Motivation\nReproducibility has been elusive in large part due to the proprietary nature of associated software and data for CGE modelling but also due to the shear complexity of compiling a single model run. A single “simple” model run for example broadly involves:\n\nTablo model selection\nVariable omissions\nClosure selection including any swaps\nShock designation\nSet mappings\nBasedata loading and aggregation\nParameter weighting and aggregation\nSelection of matrix solution methods\nNumber of step and subinterval designations\n\nIndeed, in the course of building the TEEMS framework we have found that without a reproducible architecture, there is a very high possibility of persistent logic errors propagating through to the output without any obvious indications that this is taking place in most cases. Models which incorporate time steps and additional auxillary data (e.g., land-use data) or are coupled with other models such as is the case with most integrated assessment models (IAMs) are even more complex, and therefore susceptable to a wide range of errors. Ultimately we hope that this software mitigates the steep learning curve requisite to running equilibrium models and allows scientists from various disciplines to advance model representation of their fields. The TLDR – running a CGE model does not have to be so hard!\nFinally, in addition to their proprietary nature, existing software for running CGE models relies upon graphical user interfaces which allow convenient, poses a barrier to greater adoption by non-specialists as well as severely restricts the available range of tools due to the absence of a flourishing ecosystem such as that which can be found within more widely adopted scripting languages such as R.",

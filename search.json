    "text": "1 Introduction\nReproducibility within computable general equilibrium (CGE) and partial equilibrium modelling analyses has long been elusive. This is in large part due to the proprietary nature of associated software and data but also due to the shear complexity of compiling a single model run. In this paper we present TEEMS (Trade and Environmental Equilibrium Modeling System), an open and modular pipeline software platform which handles all aspects of an equilibrium model run from head to tail. TEEMS consists of several computational layers. At its core is a C-based solver capable of solving a large system of nonlinear equations by leveraging a range of mathematical and scientific computation libraries within an Ubuntu operating system. This solver has been containerized within Singularity, a program tailored to the needs of high-performance, scientific computing. At the outer layer TEEMS leverages the R-based {targets} pipeline package to create a reproducible workflow which allows the user to seamlessly adjust model components including set aggregations, parameter weighting, closure and shock specifications as well as a large number of options pertaining to the solution and model outputs. The entire framework is built within a Docker container which facilitates easy portability as well as access to the model by specialists outside this niche field. In the course of building the TEEMS framework we have found that without a reproducible architecture, there is a very high possibility of persistent logic errors propagating through to the output without any obvious indications that this is taking place. Ultimately we hope that this software mitigates the steep learning curve requisite to running equilibrium models and allows scientists from various disciplines to advance model representation of their fields.\nPipeline tools coordinate the pieces of computationally demanding analysis projects. The targets package is a Make-like pipeline tool for statistics and data science in R. The package skips costly runtime for tasks that are already up to date, orchestrates the necessary computation with implicit parallel computing, and abstracts files as R objects. If all the current output matches the current upstream code and data, then the whole pipeline is up to date, and the results are more trustworthy than otherwise.",
